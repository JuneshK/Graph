Choose THREE algorithms to solve the shortest path problem and do the following:
•	Write the algorithms.
•	Implement the algorithms in any programming language to solve any shortest path problem (you should use the three algorithms to solve the same problem).
•	Compare the algorithms in terms of performance and identify the best among them using the below concepts whenever they exist.
o	Time complexity using step count
o	Order of magnitude using big-oh notation
o	Worst case
o	Average case
o	Best case
